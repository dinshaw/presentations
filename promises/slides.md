## Promises
<p class='fragment'>* Return a promise, immediately</p>
<p class='fragment'>* Executes</p>
<p class='fragment'>* Fulfills or Rejects</p>
<p class='fragment'>* Chainable / "thenable"</p>

***

## Fulfill and Reject

```ruby
    Promise.new { |fulfill, reject|
      if something
        fulfill.call something.value
      else
        reject.call something.error
      end
    }
```
