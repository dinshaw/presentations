<p>Feedback on our existing <a href="http://techblog.constantcontact.com/">tech blog</a>.</p>

<p>* Disclaimer - i’m not saying i’m right here, but the conversation needs to start</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>Recommendations (in no particular order):</p>

<ul>
<li>Define our target audiences</li>

<li>Define some subject matter guidelines</li>

<li>Tailor the post classification to the newly defined audiences</li>

<li>Offer incentives to write posts</li>

<li>Hire a technical writer to proof and edit all posts</li>

<li>Re-skin</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="target_audience">Target audience</h2>

<p>There is no consistent target audience across posts. After going over the posts, I discern the following disparate audiences:</p>

<ol>
<li>Marketing</li>

<li>Internal</li>

<li>Specialized</li>

<li>Developer</li>

<li>Existing Customer</li>

<li>No idea</li>
</ol>

<p>There are a couple ways that I can think of to address this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Have more than one blog. At the very least internal and external.</li>

<li>Pick a target and delete the irrelevant posts</li>

<li>Clearly classify (tag?) by audience and default to something relevant to whomever we define as our primary target</li>
</ol>

<p>To be relevant to the Ruby community, the target audience needs to be entry-level to senior-level Rubyists (I don’t think we really have the fire-power to target the cutting-edge crowd, yet).</p>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://techblog.constantcontact.com/">current design</a> is out-dated, uninviting, and difficult to scan and read. There are glaring design and typography anti-patterns that I can enumerate if need be. It is scheduled for an overhaul to match the <a href="http://blogs.constantcontact.com/">marketing blog</a> (i think), however even our <a href="http://blogs.constantcontact.com/">marketing blog</a> has much room for improvement. Here is a beautiful blog: <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/">html5rocks.com</a>. Being that our business is helping people develop their online-presence, it would seem reasonable to have a higher bar for public-facing sites. We could/should to be winning awards for this stuff, as opposed to being passable.</p>

<p>I ported one of our existing posts over to this layout for a side-by-side:</p>

<p>old: <a href="http://techblog.constantcontact.com/software-development/using-cors-for-cross-domain-ajax-requests/">Using CORS for Cross-Domain Ajax Requests</a></p>

<p>new: <a href="http://localhost:4000/2014/01/02/cors.html">CORS for X-Domain Ajax</a></p>

<h2 id="content">Content</h2>

<p>People come back to a blog because they expect more of whatever they liked in the first place. We need some common thread, weather it is target-audience, writing style, subject-matter, or other. We currently do not have consistency in any of the above.</p>
