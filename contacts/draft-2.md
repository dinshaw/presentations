# Brief Bantam History - 1 min

# Brief Architecture history - 5 min
* The problem: replace a huge, undocumented app with paying users. Build for 500k and x tps
* One page app; ui and service; consume our own api!
* So we just started building... which was the right thing to do, i.e.: do what you would normally do.
* Then we started getting fancy and added Solr
* And we TTD'd, cuz that's how we do, and we got to:
** Integration tests in ui, needed to spin up api, and solr, and, artifice/sinatra service stubs - what is solr good for?? redisS
* Getting started now included a launchctl
* Consolodate apps and swiched to Webmock (in process), thank god...
* Couch, no. Mysql, yes.
