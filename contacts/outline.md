## intro

## Beginning
* Don't tantalize
* Challenge of building to scale
* Rails at app-scale, and team-scale
** Not everyone on your team is going to be a rockstar
** tech lead will miss something, you will get tired
** Choose your battles
* No idea what we were doing
** Freelance -> salary, whatever?


## Middle
Things we did?
Tools we used?
Tools we should have used?

* Migrations are a big deal
* Start with a normal app
* No bootstrap

### The path
* choose tec
* Change tec
* Begin to scale
* v2 api/ tdd
* tdd
* DB Refactor
* V3 Api
* Dead code and git blame!
* Ownership, look for problems, question everything
* People are explaining stuff, don't try to be cool, make them explain it - if they can't, it probably doesn't work
* Replace JSON
* People will burnout on the same shit - careful mgrs! - pair up to avoid this
* What's the biggest value of pair-programming? Company.
* Benchmarj
* Profile
